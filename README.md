## About Me!
I'm a former English teacher who started working in tech in 2021. I used to teach Americna Literature and Biritish Literature in Florida before starting at GitLab, followed by ProjectDiscovery, and now GitHub! Read about my Journey to tech [here!](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/from-english-teacher-to-developer-advocate/)

The first computer I owned (not my family) was probably a super thick Toshiba laptop that my grandfather no longer needed in around 2001. It had MAYBE 500 MB of space on it and was always breaking (mostly becuase I was breaking it by messing with too many settings). I had to use so many floppy disks to hold all the pictures and music on it I wanted. It had one of those red mouse pointer things in the middle.
